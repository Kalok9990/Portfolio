# Portfolio
This is a portfolio I made to practice using HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

# Difficulties
I have added a carousel to my portfolio which shows off my photography. However, I found it difficult to use CSS to adjust the carousel itself as well as getting the images to fit within the carousel. As you can see, the images are still not fitted correctly.

# Good things
I am happy with the overall page. I have learnt a lot in this week about CSS and the use of Git. I would have struggled to make this page last week as I only touched on CSS quite briefly so this is a __big__ step for me.
